## WARNING

This project is a personal endeavor, primarily serving as a playground for experimenting with technologies like Fyne and Viper. It was recently revived and refined with the assistance of the Gemini CLI, showcasing a "vibecoding" approach.

**Please note:** This application is not intended to be a perfectly polished or production-ready tool. Its primary purpose is learning and exploration.

Special thanks to [sebhulse](https://fitness.sebhulse.com/index.html) for providing his excellent workout API, and to [everkinetic](https://github.com/everkinetic/data) for their open-source exercise images, used here under specific license circumstances.
